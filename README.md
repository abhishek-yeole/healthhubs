### Welcome to HealthHub - Your Health. Your Hub. Your Journey.

Welcome to HealthHub, a Comprehensive ecosystem for health and wellness. Embark on a journey towards a healthier, happier you. It consists of multiple features such as Machine learning Models for disease classification and detection, Happiness index survey, Health related reports with various calculators such as Body Mass Index (BMI), Body Fat, BMR, etc. Along with it it also consists of a HeathBot for specific diseases and a few suggestions for and lightening up mood of the user.

## ChatBot LLM
The ChatBot - HealthBot was built using a free GPT provider - _[gpt4free](https://pypi.org/project/gpt4free/0.0.2.6/)_
   - The API endpoint for prompt engineering and user query was built using Flask.
   - Then it is connected to the frontend ChatUI by Gradio.

## Run it locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm init`

Installs the required the libraries on the local machine. Also install required libraries if not installed use:

- Install force library: `npm install force`
- Install pakages with conflicting dependencies using force: `npm install package_install_name --force`

> **NOTE**: Do not use npm: `--legacy-peer-deps` library. It will break down Spline runtime and Spline react-spline libraries causing error.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
