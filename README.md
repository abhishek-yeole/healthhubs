## Run it locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm init`

Installs the required the libraries on the local machine. Also install required libraries if not installed use:

- Install force library: `npm install force`
- Install pakages with conflicting dependencies using force: `npm install package_install_name --force`

> **NOTE**: Do not use npm: `--legacy-peer-deps` library. It will break down Spline runtime and Spline react-spline libraries causing error.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
